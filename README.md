# Chat Microfrontend (MFE)

A modern React-based chat microfrontend that communicates with an AI agent using Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time communication.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Modern React UI** - Clean, responsive design with smooth animations
- ðŸ“¡ **Server-Sent Events** - Real-time communication without WebSocket complexity
- ðŸ’¬ **Real-time Chat** - Instant message delivery and display
- ðŸ”Œ **Flexible Connection** - Connect to any agent URL
- ðŸ“± **Mobile Responsive** - Works perfectly on all device sizes
- ðŸŽ¨ **Beautiful Design** - Gradient backgrounds and modern UI components
- âš¡ **Auto-reconnection** - Automatically reconnects on connection loss

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kriarar82/chat-mfe.git
cd chat-mfe
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Usage

### Connecting to an Agent

The Chat MFE automatically connects to the configured agent URL on startup. No manual connection is required.

1. The application automatically connects to the agent when loaded
2. Start chatting! Your messages will be sent to the agent via HTTP POST requests
3. Agent responses will be received in real-time via Server-Sent Events
4. The agent URL is configured per environment (see Configuration section)

### Message Types

- **User Messages** - Messages you send (appear on the right, blue gradient)
- **Agent Messages** - Responses from the agent (appear on the left, gray background)
- **System Messages** - Connection status and error messages (centered, yellow background)

## Architecture

### Components

- **ChatContainer** - Main container managing state and SSE connection
- **MessageList** - Displays all messages with auto-scroll
- **Message** - Individual message component with sender identification
- **MessageInput** - Text input with auto-resize and keyboard shortcuts
- **ConnectionStatus** - Visual indicator of connection state

### SSE Implementation

The application uses a custom `useSSE` hook that:
- Establishes EventSource connection to the agent
- Handles connection state management
- Provides auto-reconnection on connection loss
- Manages message sending via HTTP POST requests

### Message Flow

1. User types message and presses Enter
2. Message is added to local state immediately
3. Message is sent to agent via HTTP POST to `/api/send-message`
4. Agent processes message and sends response via SSE
5. Response is received and displayed in real-time

## Agent Integration

To integrate with your agent, ensure it supports:

1. **SSE Endpoint** - Sends messages via Server-Sent Events
2. **HTTP POST Endpoint** - Receives messages at `/api/send-message`

### Expected Agent Response Format

The agent should send messages in one of these formats:

**JSON Format:**
```json
{
  "content": "Hello! How can I help you?",
  "message": "Hello! How can I help you?"
}
```

**Plain Text Format:**
```
Hello! How can I help you?
```

## Configuration

The Chat MFE uses environment-based configuration. Agent URLs and other settings are configured per environment:

### Environment Files
- **Development**: `src/config/environments/development.js`
- **Staging**: `src/config/environments/staging.js`  
- **Production**: `src/config/environments/production.js`

### Key Configuration
- **Agent URL**: Static URL for the agent API (no user input required)
- **Auto-connect**: Automatically connects on startup
- **User ID**: Configurable default user ID
- **Debug Mode**: Environment-specific debug settings

### Environment Variables
Override configuration using environment variables:
```bash
REACT_APP_AGENT_URL=https://your-agent-api.com/chat
REACT_APP_APP_NAME=My Chat MFE
REACT_APP_DEBUG=false
```

See `CONFIGURATION.md` for detailed configuration options.

## Customization

### Styling

All components use CSS modules for styling. You can customize:
- Colors in component CSS files
- Gradients in `App.css` and `ChatContainer.css`
- Animations and transitions
- Responsive breakpoints

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- Ensure the agent URL is correct and accessible
- Check that the agent supports CORS for your domain
- Verify the agent is running and accepting SSE connections

### Message Not Sending

- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the agent's HTTP POST endpoint is working
- Ensure the message format matches agent expectations

### Styling Issues

- Clear browser cache
- Check for CSS conflicts
- Verify all CSS files are loading correctly
